# Flask Application Factory Pattern Template

Before you run, it is recommended to create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv` and activate it using `source venv/bin/activate` on Linux or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows.
After that, install the dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Run this application using the command `flask run` or `python -m flask run`.
